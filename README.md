# IMDB-CLONE 

Here, I'm create a mini IMDb clone app project.
In this project I'm using a simple HTML, CSS and VANILLA JAVASCRIPT.
I create some files to make this project.
The first file I create (index.html) for the home page of our project and the second one is (style.css)  to give some desingn to our project and the third one is (script.js) to handle all the functions and events to our project.
I created another separate files for our movie pages and watchlists in this section I also created each section with three files of HTML, CSS and JS.
